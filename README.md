R scripts used for population, subspecies, and species mitogenome divergence and simulations

Pairwise_divergence includes the R scripts for all pairwise divergence measures between designated strata, based on input haplotype sequences (fasta file) and csv file with the list of samples, their haplotype names (associated with haplotype sequences in the fasta file), and strata designations for one or more pairs of strata to be compaired.
